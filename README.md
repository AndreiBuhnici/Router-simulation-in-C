# Router-simulation-in-C
- Simulates different functions of a router and its protocols;
- The topology of the scheme is : 2 routers connected with each other, both with 2 stations connected;
- Both routers implement the same protocols;
- The idea was to simulate this type of network in C;
- ARP Protocol (Request / Reply) with associated ARP table for routers;
- Routing IPV4 Table;
- Routing process consists in verifying checksum, ttl, there is a route to destination and that the packet is not an ICMP packet;
- Longest prefix match(LPM) for getting the best route with binary search in Routing Table;
- ICMP Protocol for ping functionality and error management;
- Incremental Checksum;
